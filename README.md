# circle_experiments
to experiment with circle ci 

I want to know if it is possible to orchastrate provisioning a VPS from vultr and configuring DNS settings for said VPS from circle ci. This repository is an experiment towards that answer. 

Stuff I've accomplished so far:

* An account with circleci to auto-run script on repo updates
* Project workflow running on circleci

... doesn't look like it's possible to publish workflow (and their status) with circleci. That's .. sad. :(
